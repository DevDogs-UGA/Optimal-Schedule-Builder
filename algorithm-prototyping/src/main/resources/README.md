```

- `scripts/generate_professors_outline.py`: Python script that generates a JSON file called `professors.json` containing all the professors in `courses.json` with `quality` set to `0` for easy data entry.

- `professors.json`: JSON file containing sample professor data. Includes all professors listed in `courses.json` and their corresponding RateMyProfessor quality ratings. If the professor has no RateMyProfessor rating, their quality is null.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Daniel Barnum",
    "quality": 5
  },
  ...
]
```

- `scripts/generate_buildings_outline.py`: Python script that generates a JSON file called `buildings.json` containing all the buildings in `courses.json` with `x` and `y` set to `0` for easy data entry.

- `buildings.json`: JSON file containing sample building data. Includes all buildings listed in `courses.json` and their corresponding positions based on the map found in the [`Algorithm Prototyping`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J2_vlChwx_oWGYKRrmDkDBzWY6dORn6v/view?usp=drive_link) document.

```json
[
  {
   "name": "Park Hall",
    "x": 3,
    "y": 2
  },
  ...
]
```

- `scripts/generate_distances.py`: Python script that generates a JSON file called `distances.json` containing a distance matrix for the buildings in `buildings.json` using the Euclidean distance formula.

- `distances.json`: JSON file containing a precomputed distance matrix generated by `scripts/generate_distances.py`, where each building name is a key to an object that maps other buildings to their distances.

```json
{
  "Park Hall": {
    "Park Hall": 0.0,
    "Boyd": 10.0,
    ...
  },
  "Boyd": {
    "Park Hall": 10.0,
    "Boyd": 0.0,
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

- `./buildingData/AthensBuildingData.json`, `./buildingData/GriffinBuildingData.json`, `./buildingData/TiftonBuildingData.json`: JSON files that generally ties the "Building Code", "Longitude", and "Latitude" of UGA buildings together. Some of the "Address" and "Name" sections may a bit off. All coordinate data comes from [ArcGIS](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=10832e7927124404a7119df52872af84&marker=-83.36976500828429,33.942891604835,,,,&markertemplate=%7B%22title%22:%22Building+2130%22,%22longitude%22:-83.36976500828429,%22latitude)
